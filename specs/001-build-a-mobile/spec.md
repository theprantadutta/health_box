# Feature Specification: HealthBox Mobile Medical Data Manager

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-mobile`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a mobile-first flutter application called **HealthBox** that allows users to securely store and organize medical data, including prescriptions, lab reports, medications, vaccination history, allergies, and chronic conditions. The app should support multiple family member profiles, work fully offline with an encrypted local database, and allow optional synchronization with the user's own Google Drive account. It should include reminders for medications and appointments, filtering and tagging of records, emergency medical cards, and offline data export/import. Privacy is paramount: no central server, no mandatory login, everything remains on the user's device unless they explicitly sync with Drive."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A family caregiver needs to securely store and organize medical information for multiple family members on their mobile device. They want to track medications, appointments, lab reports, and medical history without relying on internet connectivity or third-party servers. When needed, they can quickly access emergency medical information or export data for healthcare providers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user opens the app for the first time, **When** they complete initial setup, **Then** they can create their first family member profile and begin adding medical records
2. **Given** a user has multiple family member profiles, **When** they switch between profiles, **Then** they see only that person's medical data and can manage it independently
3. **Given** a user is offline with no internet connection, **When** they access the app, **Then** all stored medical data remains fully accessible and editable
4. **Given** a user has set up medication reminders, **When** it's time for a dose, **Then** they receive a notification with medication details and can mark it as taken
5. **Given** a user wants to share medical data with a healthcare provider, **When** they export records, **Then** they can generate a comprehensive report or emergency medical card
6. **Given** a user chooses to sync with Google Drive, **When** they authenticate, **Then** their encrypted data is backed up and can be restored on other devices

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user's device storage is full and they try to add new medical records?
- How does the system handle corrupted or incomplete medical data entries?
- What occurs if Google Drive sync fails or connection is interrupted during backup?
- How are medication reminders handled when the device is in airplane mode or powered off?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create and manage multiple family member profiles without requiring account registration
- **FR-002**: System MUST store all medical data locally in an encrypted database that works offline
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to add, edit, and delete medical records including prescriptions, lab reports, medications, vaccination history, allergies, and chronic conditions
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide medication and appointment reminder functionality with customizable notifications
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to filter and tag medical records for easy organization and retrieval
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate emergency medical cards containing critical health information
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to export medical data in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific format requirements not specified - PDF, CSV, JSON?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST support import of previously exported medical data
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide optional Google Drive synchronization for data backup and restore
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain full functionality without internet connectivity
- **FR-011**: System MUST encrypt all stored medical data to protect patient privacy
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to control what data is synchronized to Google Drive
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide search functionality across all medical records within a profile

- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain data integrity and prevent corruption during offline operations

### Key Entities
- **Family Member Profile**: Represents an individual person's complete medical identity, containing personal info and serving as the container for all medical records
- **Medical Record**: Base entity representing any piece of medical information, with common attributes like date, notes, tags, and attachments
