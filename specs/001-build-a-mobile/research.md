# Research: HealthBox Mobile Medical Data Manager

## Flutter Framework Research

**Decision**: Flutter 3.16+ with Dart 3.2+
**Rationale**: Cross-platform development with single codebase, excellent Material 3 support, mature ecosystem for medical apps, strong performance on both iOS and Android, extensive package ecosystem for required features
**Alternatives considered**: Native iOS/Android (rejected due to duplicate effort), React Native (rejected due to less mature encryption support), Xamarin (deprecated by Microsoft)

## State Management Research

**Decision**: Riverpod for state management
**Rationale**: Compile-time safety, excellent testing support, provider-based architecture scales well with complex medical data relationships, eliminates boilerplate compared to BLoC, better performance than Provider
**Alternatives considered**: BLoC (rejected due to boilerplate), Provider (rejected due to runtime errors), GetX (rejected due to tight coupling)

## Database & Encryption Research

**Decision**: Drift (SQLite) with SQLCipher encryption
**Rationale**: Strong typing with Dart integration, built-in migration support, excellent offline capabilities, SQLCipher provides AES-256 encryption meeting HIPAA requirements, proven in medical applications
**Alternatives considered**: Hive (rejected due to limited query capabilities), Isar (rejected due to encryption complexity), Firebase local (rejected due to Google dependency for core features)

## UI Framework Research

**Decision**: Material 3 (Material You) design system
**Rationale**: Modern, accessible design language, native Flutter support, excellent theming system supporting light/dark modes, follows platform conventions on both iOS and Android, strong accessibility features
**Alternatives considered**: Cupertino only (rejected due to Android consistency), Custom design system (rejected due to development time), Material 2 (deprecated)

## Notification System Research

**Decision**: flutter_local_notifications
**Rationale**: Comprehensive scheduling support for medication reminders, cross-platform consistency, support for custom notification actions, works fully offline, allows rich notification content with medication details
**Alternatives considered**: Platform-specific notifications (rejected due to duplicate code), firebase_messaging (rejected due to server dependency)

## Cloud Sync Research

**Decision**: Google Drive API with end-to-end encryption
**Rationale**: User-controlled storage respecting privacy, robust API with offline sync capabilities, encrypted blob storage prevents Google from accessing medical data, established authentication flow
**Alternatives considered**: Dropbox API (rejected due to less robust sync), iCloud (rejected due to Android limitations), Custom server (rejected due to privacy concerns and infrastructure costs)

## Export/Import Research

**Decision**: PDF reports via pdf package, encrypted ZIP archives via archive package
**Rationale**: PDF is universal format for medical records sharing, ZIP compression reduces storage footprint, client-side encryption maintains privacy, structured export enables data portability
**Alternatives considered**: Excel export (rejected due to formatting complexity), Cloud document sharing (rejected due to privacy), Plain text (rejected due to poor formatting)

## OCR Integration Research

**Decision**: Google ML Kit for optional OCR functionality
**Rationale**: On-device processing maintains privacy, no internet required, optimized for mobile performance, good accuracy for printed medical text, integrated with Flutter
**Alternatives considered**: Cloud OCR services (rejected due to privacy), Custom ML models (rejected due to complexity), Third-party OCR SDKs (rejected due to licensing costs)

## File Storage Research

**Decision**: Local file system with path_provider for platform-appropriate directories
**Rationale**: Direct file system access for attachments, respects platform storage conventions, enables offline access, supports large files, integrates with system file pickers
**Alternatives considered**: Embedded blob storage in database (rejected due to size limitations), Cloud storage for files (rejected due to privacy requirements)

## Authentication Research

**Decision**: No central authentication - optional device biometric unlock
**Rationale**: Privacy-first approach eliminates central authority, device biometrics provide convenient security, aligns with offline-first principle, reduces attack surface
**Alternatives considered**: Email/password (rejected due to server dependency), OAuth providers (rejected due to privacy), PIN codes (implemented as backup option)

## Testing Strategy Research

**Decision**: Flutter test framework with integration tests using real database
**Rationale**: Comprehensive testing of UI and business logic, integration tests validate database operations, widget tests ensure UI correctness, follows constitutional requirements for real dependencies
**Alternatives considered**: Mock-based testing (rejected by constitution), Unit tests only (insufficient coverage), Manual testing only (not scalable)

## Architecture Pattern Research

**Decision**: Feature-based library architecture with direct service calls
**Rationale**: Modular design enables independent feature development, direct calls avoid unnecessary abstractions, aligns with constitutional simplicity requirements, scalable for large medical app
**Alternatives considered**: Repository pattern (rejected due to added complexity without benefit), Clean Architecture (rejected due to over-engineering), MVC pattern (rejected due to tight coupling)

## Internationalization Research

**Decision**: Flutter intl package with ARB files
**Rationale**: Standard Flutter localization approach, supports medical terminology translation, enables right-to-left languages, good tooling support
**Alternatives considered**: Custom i18n solution (rejected due to maintenance overhead), Third-party packages (rejected due to dependencies)

## Performance Optimization Research

**Decision**: Lazy loading with pagination for large datasets, image caching for attachments
**Rationale**: Maintains 60fps performance with thousands of records, reduces memory footprint, improves app startup time, essential for smooth UI interactions
**Alternatives considered**: Load all data at startup (rejected due to performance), Virtual scrolling (complex implementation), Database indexing only (insufficient for UI performance)
